Fun With Lottery
================

Description:
--------------

  This program is for fun only and its not going to help you win the lottery. Instead it will show you how difficult it is to win or maybe give you the feeling that you did win. That is if your computer/you are lucky enough to match the numbers
  
I've done it twice myself:

**4,541,319 tickets played** |    
[20, 43, 51, 55, 57, 4]
winner - ['Match All 6 - [20, 43, 51, 55, 57, 4]']

**25,334,197 tickets played** |   
[20, 43, 51, 55, 57, 4]
winner - ['Match All 6 - [20, 43, 51, 55, 57, 4]']
